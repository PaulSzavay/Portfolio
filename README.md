# Portfolio

I was inspired by this person's Portfolio (https://www.lokkeestudios.com/) and wanted to emulate similar aspects. I feel like this project really helped me better understand css position. For the email form, I have a email.js account created. I still need to work on media queries before it ever gets deployed to the public but I am quite pleased with the work I did.
